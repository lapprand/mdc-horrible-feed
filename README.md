# MDC Manga

MDC Manga is a site I created for the sake of learning more about Material Design, JavaScript, TypeScript, SASS/SCSS and Webpack.

## Usage

Use a package manager (`npm` or `yarn`) to install dependencies then run the serve script.

```bash
$ npm i

$ npm run serve
```

Now the project should be running locally.
